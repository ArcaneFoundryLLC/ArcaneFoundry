## When You Need Help

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Build errors**: Check TypeScript types and imports
2. **Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind classes and CSS specificity
3. **Component not working**: Check browser console for errors
4. **Forms not submitting**: Verify service configuration

## Ready to Start?

**Your first command:**
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest arcane-foundry --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

**Remember:** Start simple, build incrementally, and test everything. You're building a conversion-focused site, not a work of art. Get it working first, then make it beautiful.

**Next step after project creation:** Follow the detailed roadmap in `Development_Roadmap.md`
